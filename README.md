# Notes to self

To render to PDF, preserving parsability use: 
`prince http://localhost:1313 --page-size=A2 --page-margin=0 -o ~/desktop/AAckerman_resume.pdf`
Make sure that the contacts partial has real HTML in it (Prince can't compute css as well as chrome does)

### Viewing

    $ hugo server

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser.

### Building
